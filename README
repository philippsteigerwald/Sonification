the colored circles represent the electrodes which extract EEG data from the brain.
the extracted data of each electrode is splitted into 4 frequency bands (gamma, lo-beat, hi-beta, alpha) which have a distinct
sound each. think of your cursor as the area within the brain with the overall highest brain activity at the moment.

// BUGS
- volume of elctrode decreases when cursor gets near it, should be increasing (FIXED)

// TODO
- panning
- logarithmic amplitude in relation to distance of cursor
- background image
- better sounds
- start/stop button
- 4 channel mixer for each electrode (gamma, lo-beat, hi-beta, alpha); each frequeny band with unique oscillator
